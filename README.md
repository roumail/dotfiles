# Dot files

TODO: 
- app-2-configs is outdated and I should do a symlink approach to make sure 
any changes in these files are always caught here for easy commit back up to remote
* Make sure to sync changes from work laptop too for vscode, cmder, app-2-configs
* Test dev-env-setup to use both bash and vim setup
