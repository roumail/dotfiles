# Dot files

This is an attempt to keep track of important configuration in a repository for easy 
setup and installation on a fresh machine. 

Some configuration relates to cmder, some to wsl for work.

There is a separate folder for the setup I have on my mac.

TODO: vim rc is currently in a separate repository while I experiment with it in a 
containerized manner. Eventually, I'd like to have that part of the same dotfiles repo
